### Four prompts

* What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
  > The most interesting topic covered during quarter 1 was the common problems of oversquashig and oversmoothing in GNN’s due to long-range interactions. This topic is interesting because we had to investigate and look into potential solutions to overcome these phenomena during information passing of large networks without having to simplify the model to gain similar node embeddings. Solutions include the concept of Differential Group Normalization.
* Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
  > I would like to play more with these classification and regression models and analyze performances on different datasets to see what other attributes may lead to a higher accuracy and how this could be used to overcome oversoothing or oversquashing in particular models frameworks. 
* What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
  > Currently, I would like to implement more code analysis into my project and dive deeper to understand why certain models perform the way they do. Right now, my project is more of an analysis when I would like to make it more of a test and discover to draw conclusions. 
* What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
  > I would like to create more tables and charts to gather my information in one area for analysis. Moreover, I want to draw from works of other scientists who have researched this and not only from the sources we have been provided by professors.
